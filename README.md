This project demonstrates how to fetch user data from a public API using JavaScript's Fetch API, and display it in a clean, styled interface. Unlike a typical API viewer, this version replaces original names and emails with custom values (like Aalok, Ram, Shivam, etc.), showing how to manipulate and override API data dynamically.
